                                of the places where Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth. Later the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and during this 
                                time it flourished, becoming an important trade center, especially for spices. Noted carvers, the Nabataeans chiseled dwellings, temples, 
                                and tombs into the sandstone, which changed color with the shifting sun. In addition, they constructed a water system that allowed for lush 
                                gardens and farming. At its height, Petra reportedly had a population of 30,000. </p>

                                widely thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850 km) long; a disputed Chinese study, however, claims the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km). 
                                Work began in the 7th century BCE and continued for two millennia. Although called a “wall,” the structure actually features two parallel 
                                walls for lengthy stretches. In addition, watchtowers and barracks dot the bulwark. One not-so-great thing about the wall, however, was its 
                                effectiveness. </p>

                                1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It took about 22 years and 20,000 workers to construct the complex, which includes an immense garden 
                                with a reflecting pool. The mausoleum is made of white marble that features semiprecious stones in geometric and floral patterns. Its majestic

                                620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters) and features a complex system of vaults. It was capable of holding 50,000 spectators, who watched a 
                                variety of events. Perhaps most notable were gladiator fights, though men battling animals was also common. In addition, water was sometimes 
                                pumped into the Colosseum for mock naval engagements. However, the belief that Christians were martyred there—namely, by being thrown to 
                                lions—is debated. According to some estimates, about 500,000 people died in the Colosseum. </p>

                                confounded scholars. Bingham believed it was home to the “Virgins of the Sun,” women who lived in convents under a vow of chastity. 
                                Others think that it was likely a pilgrimage site, while some believe it was a royal retreat.  </p>

                                Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the Toltecs—a number of important monuments and temples were built. Among the most notable is the

                                Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was completed five years later. The resulting monument stands 98 feet 
                                (30 meters) tall—not including its base, which is about 26 feet (8 meters) high—and its outstretched arms span 92 feet (28 meters). It is
